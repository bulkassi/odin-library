# odin-library

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It involved creating the library for adding books (as an array of objects), modifying their "read" status or removing them, and displaying them on the page. `dialog` (modal dialog) and `form` HTML elements were used for book addition interface. Newly and previously learned material about JavaScript (Object constuctors, prototypal inheritance, DOM manipulation, event delegation, etc) was used during creation of this project.
